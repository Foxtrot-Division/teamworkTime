# teamworkTime
As a company, we use Teamwork (teamwork.com) to log all of our time, facilitating billing,
payroll, and recordkeeping.  When subcontracting, we often find ourselves having
to use third-party timekeeping systems as part of the contract requirements. 

To reduce the burden of multiple timekeeping systems, we've created the
teamworkTime library to integrate third-party timekeeping systems with Teamwork,
and automate Teamwork time entry as best as possible.

A package is available for each supported third-party timekeeping system.  The
initial release includes support for the Unanet timekeeping system.
